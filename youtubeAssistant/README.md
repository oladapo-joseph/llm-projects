# 🎥 Youtube Assistant

Welcome to the **Youtube Assistant** project! 🚀  
Ever wished you could quickly summarize a long YouTube video or interact with its content by asking questions? This project demonstrates how to leverage **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to make that possible. The same concept can also be applied to documents you want to summarize or query.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Summarize YouTube Videos**: Extract key insights without watching the entire video.
- **Interactive Q&A**: Ask questions about the video content and get precise answers.
- **Document Summarization**: Extend the functionality to summarize and query documents.
