## Youtube Assistant


This is a simple project on how to use LLMS, imagine a case when you are unable to listen a full video
on youtube, what if you are able to summarise the video and get the key things you need, what if you are able to interact and ask questions about the video.

The concept is applicable to documents you want to summarise, and ask questions about.

```
git pull 'repo'
pip install -r requirements.txt
